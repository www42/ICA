# CloudFormation

## VS Code Extensions

* [CloudFormation extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aws-scripting-guy.cform) by [aws-scripting-guy](https://github.com/aws-scripting-guy) is a collection of snippets. I use it as a starting point for my own snippets.

* [Serverless IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ThreadHeap.serverless-ide-vscode) by [ThreadHeap](https://github.com/pavelvlasov) has nice integration to AWS docs.
